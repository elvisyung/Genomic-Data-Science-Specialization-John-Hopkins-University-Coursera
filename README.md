# Genomic Data Science Specialization John Hopkins University Coursera

About this Specialization: 
With genomics sparks a revolution in medical discoveries, it becomes imperative to be able to better understand the genome, and be able to leverage the data and information from genomic datasets. Genomic Data Science is the field that applies statistics and data science to the genome. 

This Specialization covers the concepts and tools to understand, analyze, and interpret data from next generation sequencing experiments. It teaches the most common tools used in genomic data science including how to use the command line, along with a variety of software implementation tools like Python, R, and Bioconductor. 

This Specialization is designed to serve as both a standalone introduction to genomic data science or as a perfect compliment to a primary degree or postdoc in biology, molecular biology, or genetics, for scientists in these fields seeking to gain familiarity in data science and statistical tools to better interact with the data in their everyday work.

# Modules in the Specialization 
1) Introduction to Genomic Technologies 

This course introduces you to the basic biology of modern genomics and the experimental tools that we use to measure it. We'll introduce the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology and cover how next-generation sequencing can be used to measure DNA, RNA, and epigenetic patterns. You'll also get an introduction to the key concepts in computing and data science that you'll need to understand how data from next-generation sequencing experiments are generated and analyzed.  

2) Python for Data Science

This class provides an introduction to the Python programming language and the iPython notebook

3) Algorithms for DNA sequencing 

We will learn computational methods -- algorithms and data structures -- for analyzing DNA sequencing data. We will learn a little about DNA, genomics, and how DNA sequencing is used.  We will use Python to implement key algorithms and data structures and to analyze real genomes and DNA sequencing datasets.

4) Command Line Tools for Genomic Data Science

Introduces to the commands that you need to manage and analyze directories, files, and large sets of genomic data.

5) Bioconductor for Genomic Data Science

Learn to use tools from the Bioconductor project to perform analysis of genomic data.

6) Statistics for Genomic Data Science 

An introduction to the statistics behind the most popular genomic data science projects.
